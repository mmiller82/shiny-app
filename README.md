# Shiny App Project for the coursera Data Products class

This is a very simple shiny application.  It predicts the compressive strength of concrete with different concentrations of Cement and Fine Aggregate using the svm model. The application takes a type of either Cement or Fine Aggregate.  It also takes a concentration value in kg/m3. Once a type and concentration value have been selected click the submit button.  The application will display the input concentration and the predicted compressive strength.
